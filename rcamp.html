<span class="tab">    </span> FSMK has been conducting summer camps for a long time now. Our summer camps<br> 
are known for fun,knowledgeable and Freedom oriented. But in summer camps, many people<br>
 does not get the opportunity to participate due to limited number of seats. To overcome this <br>
 problem and spread our philosophies to remote level, we have thought of conducting regional <br>camps.<br>
<span class="tab">    </span> As there was a overwhelming majority in the number of participants and<br>
enthusiasts from Hassan, we have decided to conduct the regional camp in Hassan.This month,<br>
from<span style="color:red "> February 22, Thursday to February 28 ,Sunday</span> ,a four day regional camp is going to be</br>
held in Government Engineering College ,Hassan.Algorithms, database management,Operating Systems,javascript
and many more exciting topics will be covered in this camp, by professionals <br>
and highly experienced resource persons.<br>

<span class="tab">    </span> To increase the quality of the process, we are limiting the number of participants to a <br>
maximum of 100, and out of them 40% will be reserved for hosting college. If you are<br> interested and excited about this,
and like to attend the camp, registrations will be open until<br> 2 'O' clock  of February 20.<br>
