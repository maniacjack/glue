<h3 class="question">1. What is Free Software?</h3>
 
 <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span class="tab">    </span>Free Software is software which ensure that they
 provide the necessary freedom to the users, mainlythe freedom to use, study, modify and share both the original software and the
 modifications. Good examples of these are operating  systems like Ubuntu, Fedora or application softwares like VLC and Mozilla
 Firefox. On similar lines languages like C, C++, Java,  Python, Perl, Ruby and frameworks like Qt, Django, Ruby on Rails follow
 the popular free software development methodology ensuring that the languages and the necessary compilers, development kits are 
 all under free software licenses. We at FSMK, try to promote  these technologies and ensure that information and knowledge of 
 such free software reach to students. More info here.</p>
 <hr>
 
 <h3 class="question">2. Will attending such camp and learning free software technologies help me in placements?</h3>
 <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span class="tab"></span> As per a GARTNER report, 90% of Indian IT 
 organizations will use Free and open source software for their main projects by 2016. There is already a growing trend in the
 industry to prefer equivalent free software over proprietary technologies. Hence learning free software technologies will 
 definitely help students for their career in the software field.   </p>
 <hr>

 <h3 class="question">3. Will you share all the software used during the camp so that I can use it after the camp?</h3>
 <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span class="tab"></span>Workshop kit will contain a customized Ubuntu DVD 
 which will have all the necessary software used during the camp. The license of free software encourages users to share the 
 software with others and spread the word. Infact, after the camp, we would also encourage you to go back to your college and 
 share the software and course material with your friends. </p> 
 <hr>
 
 <h3 class="question">4. Can I look at the previous course material?</h3>
 <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span class="tab"></span>The previous year's course material is shared at
 FSMK's github profile here and here. Unfortunately we didn't do a very good job at collecting the material from speakers last
 time and hence you may not get all the material. Based on the past experience, we have learnt a lot and will definitely do 
 better this time in ensuring that all materials by resource persons are collected and distributed amongst students.Regarding 
 Registration</p>
 <hr>
 
 <h3 class="question">5. I have registered, where should I pay the registration fees?</h3>
 <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span>After registration, you should have got an email 
 to the registered email address regarding the payment of registration fees. Please follow the instruction as specified in it.
  However, in general, if you already have a FSMK GNU/Linux User's Group(GLUG) in your college, then do contact the core members 
  of the GLUG for payment of registration fees. If not, someone from FSMK will contact you regarding the registration fees.</p>
  <hr>
  
 <h3 class="question">6. I have paid the registration fees, but I will not able to attend the camp. Can you refund the registration
 fees?</h3>
 <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span class="tab"></span>Sorry, we have strict policy of no refunds. As we
  make necessary arrangements for the camp based on the number of people who have registered. We are sorry to hear that you will 
  not be able to attend the camp and we would encourage you to find someone who has not registered yet and who is interested to
  attend the camp in place of you.</p>
 <hr> 
 
 <h3 class="question">7. If it is about Free Software, why are you charging money?</h3>
 <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span class="tab"></span>Glad that you have this question. If you have already
  participated in any events associated with FSMK, there is a good chance that it was a free event. FSMK is a non-profit registered 
  organization with everybody working for it as volunteers. Apart from raising funds through regular college activities or supporting
  other organizations to move to free software, such events are one of our main funding sources. Though most of the registration
  fees is spent for the organizing the camp, mainly in food cost and for workshop kit, we do plan to save some money taken from 
  you as part of registration fees for future FSMK activities. However we do arrive at registration fees after getting inputs 
  from students in various colleges, ensuring that the registration fees doesnt become the main reason for a student for not 
  participating in the camp. For students coming from economic weaker sections or students from other marginal sections, we do 
  plan to give scholarships. Please do go through this link for more information about scholarships.</p>
  <hr>
  
  <h3 class="question">8. I want to attend only few days of camp, can I do that?</h3>
  <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span class="tab"></span>Sorry, since we have limited number of seats for the
   camp, we would like to entertain participants only who can be available throughout the duration of the camp. This will ensure
   that the participants can make best use of the camp. Hence, if you are registering, please ensure that you are available for the
   entire duration of the camp.</p>
   <hr>
   
   <h3 class="question">9. What are the items to be brought to the camp?</h3>
   <ul style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black">
   <li>laptops if you have</li>
   <li>pen drives</li>
   <li>wifi dongles if you have</li>
   <li>Notebook and pen</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>
   <h3 class="question">10.Will the camp be for localites only?</h3>
   <p style="font-family:TeX Gyre Chorus;color:black"><span class="tab"></span>No, but since this is a regional camp, no 
   accommodation facilities will be provided by the host.</p>
